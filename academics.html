    <h1> 9th Grade Capstone Essay (test7) </h1>
    <p> At the end of the school year, as a part of my Honors English class, I wrote a Capstone essay comparing two literary works we read during the school
    year. Here, I chose to compare the element of Providence in Zora Neale Hurston's "Their Eyes Were Watching God" and Homer's "The Odyssey."  <br/>
