    <h1> 9th Grade Capstone Essay (test15) </h1>
    <p> At the end of the school year, as a part of my Honors English class, I wrote a Capstone essay comparing two literary works we read during the school
    year. Here, I chose to compare the element of Providence in Zora Neale Hurston's "Their Eyes Were Watching God" and Homer's "The Odyssey."  <br/>

    <h1> Graphing Rational Function </h1>
    <p> 
      In my 9th grade Honors Algebra 2 class, the unit on graphing rational functions was really confusing to me. So, I decided to 
	    do some exploration on the topic on my own. I recorded my findings in this video using Screencastify and Geogebra, a graphing
	    calculator.

    <h1> Parametrics Modeling Project </h1>
    <p> 
	While learning about parametrics in my Honors Precalculus class, I used Mathematica, a computing software, to model realife problems such
	    as projectile motion and circular motion. This is the mathematic file that contains my work on the project.

    <h1> Chemistry Lab Explanations </h1>
    <p> 
	In AP Chemistry class, one of my favorite classes in sophomore year, we conducted numerous labs that reinforced concepts we learned
	    in class. While doing the labs, I often felt that I was merely following the procedures and not clearly understanding the steps.
	    So, I decided to write lab explanations for the most challenging labs we did over the course of the school year. I am happy I decided to do 
	    this because it helped me better understand the material. I was even able to share these explanations with my classmates to help
	    them as well. Here is a compilation of all the lab explanations I wrote up.
