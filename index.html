      Hi there! My name is Fiona Yan, a rising junior at The Harker School in San Jose, California. I am an aspiring researcher and 
      public speaking enthusiast striving to making knowledge of scientific breakthroughs more accessible to local communities. 
      My academic interests include science research in biology and biochemistry, and I compete in oratory and extemporaneous
      speaking in speech. Extra-curricular wise, I have been a competitive dancer for the past six years, and I am also a member
      of my family band of six, where I play the piano.
